# ==============================================================================
# Sample Ansible Inventory for MicroK8s Cluster Setup
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Replace the placeholder IP addresses with the actual private IPs of your nodes.
# 2. The first host in the `kube_masters` group is considered the "primary" master.
#    The cluster will be initialized from this node.
# 3. Ensure you have SSH access from your Ansible control node to these hosts.
# ==============================================================================

[kube_masters]
# Add your master node IPs here
192.168.1.200
192.168.1.205
# 192.168.1.112 # Add more masters if needed for a larger HA control plane

[kube_workers]
# Add your worker node IPs here
192.168.1.207
192.168.1.208
192.168.1.209
# Add more workers as needed

# This group combines masters and workers for tasks that apply to all nodes,
# such as installing microk8s.
